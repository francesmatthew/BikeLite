This is the schematic and PCB for a buck converter and 555 timer to add flashing LEDs to my bike.

The output voltage is 5.2V, (theoretically) capable of up to 2A

(5.2V is the combined forward voltage of a white and red LED in series)

The PCB contains connections for two switches: 1) enable and 2) flash disable
